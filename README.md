This repository contains the source code for the paper:

##### Asaf Levi, Philip Shilane, Sarai Sheinvald, Gala Yadgar.
### Physical vs. Logical Indexing with IDEA: Inverted Deduplication-Aware Index.
##### To appear in 22nd USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST '24), February 2024. 

#

Our implementation of the na√Øve and the deduplication-aware index is based on the Destor open-source storage system: https://github.com/fomy/destor

System requirements: Ubuntu version 16.04, and the list of dependencies installed by the script provided. 

# SETUP & INSTALL #
MAKE SURE TO USE A CLEAN UBUNTU SERVER 16.04 LTS IMAGE, IF POSSIBLE. (FROM [HERE](https://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04.7-server-amd64.iso))

An existing Ubuntu 16.04 machine is also OK. The `install_dependencies.sh` script is meant to run on a clean Ubuntu Server installation.

### install git and pull artifacts repository
Simply install git and clone the repo.
Dependencies are installed later in this README in ./install_dependencies.sh :)
```
# takes a couple of human minutes :)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git -y
git clone https://github.com/asaflevi0812/IDEA.git
cd IDEA
```

### install dependencies
Installs the libraries required for IDEA:
* BerkeleyDB
* Lucene++
* BOOST
* SSL
* GLIB
```
# takes about a minute until a single [PRESS ENTER] is required. -- sometimes it does not.
# after that, about ten minutes of installation, probably less.
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
```

# BUILD & ENVIRONMENT #

### compile
RUN this from the IDEA repository to compile the code.
```
chmod +x compile.sh
./compile.sh
```

### prepare backup and index directories
In the destor.config file (discussed later), the paths to the directories containing the destor backup and the IDEA HDD index part and SSD index part are defined.

By default, they are defined as follows:
* backup directory: working_directories/backup_directory
* HDD part directory: working_directories/index_directory
* SSD part directory: working_directories/chunk_to_file_directory

The following command creates the directories:
```
mkdir -p working_directories/backup_directory working_directories/index_directory working_directories/chunk_to_file_directory
```
and in our original setup the proper devices are mounted to these directories.

# RUN: example backup, index and lookup #

### backup
The following command creates a deduplicated backup from a given dataset path: 

`destor <dataset_path>`

The entire directory will be recursively backed up in the backup directory defined in destor.config (discussed below).

### naive index
to create a naive index from the currently stored deduplicated backup - run the following command:

`destor -n`

The index will be stored in the HDD part index directory defined in destor.config (discussed below).

### IDEA index
to create an IDEA index from the currently stored deduplicated backup - run the following command:

`destor -q`

The index parts will be stored accordingly the HDD part index directory and SSD part directory, both are defined in destor.config (discussed below).

### lookup keywords from the command line interface
use the command:

`destor -m|l <keyword1> <keyword2> <keyword3>`

where m is used for the naive index and l for the IDEA index.  For example

`destor -l hello world`

would lookup the keywords "hello" and "world" in the IDEA index.

### lookup a dictionary of keywords from a file
use the command:

`destor -m|l -f<path_to_dictionary>`

to search a list of keywords in an OR manner, i.e. if any of the terms are contained in a file, it would appear in the results.

For example use:

`destor -m -f"keywords/linux/128/file-med.txt"`

to search the file-med dictionary in the naive index.

# CONFIGURATION OPTIONS #
### destor.config
When destor is initialized, it reads a configuration file named in a fixed name, `destor.config`, which contains lines in the following format:

```
<configuration_variable> <value>
```

For example:
```
working-directory "/home/asaf.levi/destor_working_directory"
chunking-type whitespace
reverse-mapping db
```

The following values are used to configure parameters regarding IDEA and NAIVE:
* working-directory: path to a directory which will contain the deduplicated backups.
* index-directory: path to the HDD-part of an index. It will store different parts of the index according to the index type:
- NAIVE: the entire index
- IDEA: the term-to-file map
- IDEA-indirect: the term-to-chunk map
* reverse-directory: path to the SSD-part of an index. It will store different parts of the index according to the index type:
- IDEA: the file-to-path map
- IDEA-indirect: the chunk-to-file and file-to-path maps
* chunking-type: can hold the values ` whitespace` or `whitespace-reversed`. The former is our default whitespace chunking and the latter is a chunking method used for fixed-sized blocks, where the next whitespace is searched before the chunk boundary and not after. More about these two methods in the paper.
* reverse-mapping: the type of chunk-to-file 
* indirect-path-strings: whether to enable file-to-path mapping. Always set to yes in our paper.
* offsets-mode: whether to store offsets. Supported values are `none` and `term-vectors`, where `term-vectors` is the only offsets option in the paper.
* tf-idf: whether to store tf-idf values. `yes` \ `no` value.
