#### Asaf Levi, Philip Shilane, Sarai Sheinvald, Gala Yadgar. Physical vs. Logical Indexing with IDEA: Inverted Deduplication-Aware Index. To appear in 22nd USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST '24), February 2024. 
Our implementation of the na√Øve and the deduplication-aware index is based on the Destor open-source storage system: https://github.com/fomy/destor
System requirements: Ubuntu version 16.04, and the list of dependencies installed by the script provided. 

# SETUP & INSTALL #
USE A CLEAN UBUNTU SERVER 16.04 LTS IMAGE. (FROM [HERE](https://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04.7-server-amd64.iso))

### install git and pull artifacts repository
Simply install git and clone the repo.
Dependencies are installed later in this README in ./install_dependencies.sh :)
```
# takes a couple of human minutes :)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git -y
git clone https://github.com/asaflevi0812/IDEA.git
cd IDEA
```

### install dependencies
Installs the libraries required for IDEA:
* BerkeleyDB
* Lucene++
* BOOST
* SSL
* GLIB
```
# takes about a minute until a single [PRESS ENTER] is required. -- sometimes it does not.
# after that, about ten minutes of installation, probably less.
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
```

# BUILD: copy code and build artifacts #

### compile
```
chmod +x compile.sh
./compile.sh
mkdir -p working_directories/backup_directory working_directories/index_directory working_directories/chunk_to_file_directory
```

# RUN: example backup, index and lookup #

### backup
`destor datasets/LNX-3`
### naive index
`destor -n`
### IDEA index
`destor -q`
### lookup the word "hello" in the naive index
`destor -m hello`
### lookup the word "hello" in the IDEA index
`destor -l hello`
### lookup with the file-med dictionary
```
destor -m -f"keywords/linux/128/file-med.txt"
destor -l -f"keywords/linux/128/file-med.txt"
```
